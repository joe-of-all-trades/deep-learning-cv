### How can information be extracted from images? 

-Traditional approach
--Use human designed rule to process image
-Deep learning approach
--Let deep neural network learn rules from data

---
### Examples of traditional approach

-Gaussian filter
-Gabor filter
-Canny edge detector

---
### Traditional approach to image classification

1. Using image processing pipeline to extract features
2. Design rules to classify images using extracted features.

---
### Deep learning approach to image classification

1. Let deep neural network learn the features from vast amount of labeled data
